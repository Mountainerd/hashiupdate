# Hashiupdate

A work-in-progess. Nothing works. Yet. This readme will be updated as features are added, even in an in-progress state.

## Problem 

Right now, the various Hashicorp products are _fantastic_ about notifying you on the CLI that your product is
out-of-date but doesn't update the product. 

## Planned Features

- Updating of currently installed Hashicorp tools.
- Installation of products not on the current system. 
- Keep n-1 version to facilitate quick, easy rollback.

## Contributing

Helping to make this product a reality is just a pull request away.

## License
